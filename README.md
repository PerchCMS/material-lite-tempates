Some templates showing how to use Material with Perch

Perch and Perch Runway are ideally suited if you are using [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io) as we give you full control of your templates. Here are some example templates - they assume you have already included Material in your page.

The content of the `content` folder can be put directly into your `perch/templates/content` folder in [Perch](http://grabaperch.com/products/perch) or [Perch Runway](http://grabaperch.com/products/runway). Either use the templates in the `material` folder individually or in a Blocks template to allow your client to build up their pages.

Pull requests accepted if anyone wants to build some more.
